Trees are well-known as a non-linear data structure. They donâ€™t store data in a linear way. They organize data hierarchically.
Example of Tree:
1. Family Tree
2. DOM in the browser.
3. Workspace Hierarchy 
4. File system Hierarchy in OS

A tree is a collection of entities called nodes. Nodes are connected by edges. Each node contains a value or data, and it may or may not have a child node


Terminology summary.
1. **Root** is the topmost node of the tree
2. **Edge** is the link between two nodes
3. **Child** is a node that has a parent node
4. **Parent** is a node that has an edge to a child node
5. **Leaf** is a node that does not have a child node in the tree
6. **Height** is the length of the longest path to a leaf
7. **Depth** is the length of the path to its root

## Binary Trees


A binary tree is one type of data structure that has two nodes, a left node and a right node. In programming, binary trees are actually an extension of the linked list structures.
