# NPM
npm is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language. It is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. It consists of a command line client, also called npm, and an online database of public and paid-for private packages, called the npm registry. The registry is accessed via the client, and the available packages can be browsed and searched via the npm website. The package manager and the registry are managed by npm, Inc.



npm consists of three distinct components:

1. The website.

  Use the website to discover packages, set up profiles, and manage other aspects of your npm experience. For example, you can set up Orgs (organizations) to manage access to public or private packages.
  
2. the Command Line Interface (CLI).

  The CLI runs from a terminal. This is how most developers interact with npm.

3. the registry.

  The registry is a large public database of JavaScript software and the meta-information surrounding it.
