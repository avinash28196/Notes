# [Browser environment, specs](https://javascript.info/browser-environment)

The JavaScript language was initially created for web browsers. Since then, it has evolved and become a language with many uses and platforms.

A platform may be a browser, or a web-server, or a washing machine, or another host. Each of them provides platform-specific functionality. The JavaScript specification calls that a host environment.

There’s a “root” object called window. It has two roles:

1. First, it is a global object for JavaScript code, as described in the chapter Global object.
2. Second, it represents the “browser window” and provides methods to control it.
