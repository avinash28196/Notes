# Function:
  A function is a "subprogram" that can be called by code external (or internal in the case of recursion) to the function. Like the program itself, a function is composed of a sequence of statements called the function body. Values can be passed to a function, and the function will return a value.

## Declearing a function.

A Functions consists of 3 things function name, parameter and a statements that define the function and 
enclosed in curly brackets,{  }.
