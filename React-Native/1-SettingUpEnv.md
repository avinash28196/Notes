# Setting up the react Native Environment.

## Installing dependencies

You will need Node, Watchman, the React Native command line interface, and Xcode.

Need to install Xcode in order to set up the necessary tooling to build your React Native app for iOS.

Need to Install node and watchman using Homebrew.

### Note: 
1. If Node is already installed make sure it is Node 8 and above.

2. Watchman is a tool by Facebook for watching changes in the filesystem. It is highly recommended you install it for better performance.
```
brew install node
brew install watchman

```

The React Native CLI

```
npm install -g react-native-cli
```

The easiest way to install Xcode is via the Mac App Store. Installing Xcode will also install the iOS Simulator and all the necessary tools to build your iOS app.

If you have already installed Xcode on your system, make sure it is version 8 or higher.
