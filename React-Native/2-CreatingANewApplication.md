# Creating a new application

Use the React Native command line interface to generate a new React Native project called "AwesomeProject":

```
react-native init AwesomeProject
```

## Running your React Native application

Run react-native run-ios inside your React Native project folder:

```
cd AwesomeProject
react-native run-ios
```

You should see your new app running in the iOS Simulator shortly.
