Docker primarily used to develop a underlying infrastructure of an application


What is Docker

Docker enables you to separate your application from your infrastructure so you can develop and deliver the software quickly.  

Docker significantly reduces the delay between developing a application in dev environment and hosting the same in the production environment.

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Dockerâ€™s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.
