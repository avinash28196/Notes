# Basic Components

## Routers
At the core of every React Router application should be a router component. For web projects, react-router-dom provides <BrowserRouter> and <HashRouter> routers. Both of these will create a specialized history object for you. Generally speaking, you should use a <BrowserRouter> if you have a server that responds to requests and a <HashRouter> if you are using a static file server.
